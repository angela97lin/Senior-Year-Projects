DIGITAL OCEAN SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:

Set up SSH key to easily log into your box's route!
    https://cloud.digitalocean.com/ssh_keys

Create a Droplet:
       Choose name
       Select Region: New York (3)
       Choose Distributions
       You can also choose applications (Application Image)	
       Add SSH keys!
       Create the droplet!

Options:
	Power Cycle: Hard resetting of the server
	Power off
	Console Access: a login terminal in case you can't get to your box otherwise
	Resize Droplet (when it is turned off)
	Take a snapshot of your droplet (state)

You can only ssh via IP address:
    ssh root@IPADDRESS
    ifconfig to find IP address
Unless you give the box an actual name:
    Sign up for a subdomain here:
    freedns.afraid.org (free subdomain registeration)

FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO: ADD ANOTHER USER (so you do not have to rely on root)
      adduser username
      addgroup username sudo : allows username to do things as a superuser using sudo
      logout as root and login as user
      ssh-copy-id username@IPADDRESS : so you do not have to always type in password

Now to update the box...
    sudo su --> run switch user as superuser and then run things as root
OR...
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo apt-get install PACKACGE (git, emacs, python-dev, python-virtualenv, python-pip, sqlite3, mongodb, mongodb-clients)

Then... 
Generate a public ssh key for GITHUB

Then... 
Install Flask!
	sudo pip install flask gunicorn

Sharing files on the virtual box:
	scp filename MACHINENAME: (colon in terminal means machine name)
	OR
	sshfs username@machinename:shared x
	Lets you mount directories across machines.
	fusermount to unmount

sudo apt-get nginx
